# Fira PHP
Fira Code modyfication for PHP

## Problem

Fira Code is created for multiple languages, so it is not perfectly fitted to most of them (especcialy PHP). The greatest problem is with assign operator (=) and equal operator (==) looking too symilar and do not suggest it might be wrong use - instead of identical operator (===). 

### Solution

Fira PHP is Fira Code modyfication adaptet to PHP language.
